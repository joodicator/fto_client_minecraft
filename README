INTRODUCTION

This is an attempt to create a nicer version of the Mineshafter Squared client 
wrapper available from [1] that is:

  - Compatible with the latest versions of the official Minecraft client.  

  - Compatible with the open source version of Mineshafter Squared's 
    authentication server.

To do this, the source code of MineshafterSquared-Client.jar from [1] was 
extracted using [2] and modifications were made to MineProxy.java to allow the 
proxy to intercept the new format of requests made by the offial Minecraft 
client, among other changes to overcome incompatibilities between Java 7 and 
[2].
